# 🏠 Airbnb Clone — User Stories Documentation

## 🎯 Objective

Translate the **use case diagram interactions** from Task 1 into **user stories** that describe the core functionalities and user goals of the Airbnb Clone backend.

---

## 🧭 Overview

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end user.  
They help developers and stakeholders understand what users want to accomplish, why it matters, and how the system should respond.

This document provides user stories derived from the **Airbnb Clone Use Case Diagram**, covering the interactions between **Guests**, **Hosts**, and **Admins** within the system.

---

## 📚 Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to:
- Bridge the gap between **use case diagrams** and **feature implementation**.
- Define clear, testable, and user-centric requirements.
- Guide backend API and database design decisions.

- **Task 2:** [Use Case Diagram (Draw.io)](../use-case-diagram.drawio)
- **Task 3:** `user-stories.md` (this document)

---

## 🧩 Deliverables
- A Markdown file (`user-stories.md`) listing the core user stories.
- Stories should align with the **main actors**:
  - Guest
  - Host
  - Admin
- Each story should describe:
  - The actor (who)
  - The goal (what they want to do)
  - The benefit (why it matters)

## ✅ Example Format
> As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [achieve a goal].

Example:
> As a user, I want to register an account so that I can list my properties for rent.

## 🚀 Outcome
By writing these user stories, you’ll:
- Clarify system behavior before implementation.
- Enable smoother collaboration between frontend, backend, and design teams.
- Provide a foundation for writing test cases and acceptance criteria.
